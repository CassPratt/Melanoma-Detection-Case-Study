## General Information
- Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early.
- A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC).
- The **objective** is to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.

## Technologies Used
- Tensorflow version:  2.9.1
- Matplotlib version:  3.5.1
- Numpy version:  1.21.5
- Pandas version:  1.4.2
- PIL version:  9.0.1
- Augmentor version:  0.2.10
- SKLearn version:  1.0.2

## Conclusions
- Data augmentation strategies and handling class imbalance are a must to improve a model accuracy.
- Dropout strategy improves model performance (reduces overfitting) but might not be enough to improve accuracy.
- Tuning a model for an specific dataset implies testing different combinations of layers and epochs.
